\chapter{InfoBox Reference}\label{cha:infobox}
InfoBox data types are grouped into logical categories.

All InfoBoxes display their data in user-specified units.  Whenever the content 
is invalid, the displayed value will be '---' and the content is
greyed out.  This happens, for example, when no terrain elevation is found for 
the `Terrain Elevation' InfoBox, or in the same way for a derived InfoBox like 
`Height AGL'.

In the following description of the InfoBox types, the first
title is as it appears in the InfoBox configuration dialogue box, the
second title is the label used in the InfoBox title.

\section{Altitude}

\ibi{Height GPS}{H GPS}{This is the height above mean sea level reported by the
GPS. (Touch-screen/PC only) In simulation mode this value is adjustable with the
up/down arrow keys. The right/left arrow keys also cause the glider to turn.}
\ibi{Height AGL}{H AGL}{This is the navigation altitude minus the terrain height
obtained from the terrain file. The value is coloured red when the glider is
below the terrain safety clearance height.}
\ibi{Terrain elevation}{H GND}{This is the elevation of the terrain above mean
sea level obtained from the terrain file at the current GPS location.}
\ibi{Barometric altitude}{Alt. baro.}{This is the barometric altitude obtained from a
GPS or a supported external intelligent vario. equipped with pressure sensor.}
\ibi{QFE GPS}{QFE GPS}{Automatic QFE. This altitude value is constantly reset to 
0 on ground  \textit{before} taking off. After take-off, it is no more reset 
automatically even if on ground. During flight you can change QFE with up and 
down keys. Bottom line shows QNH altitude. Changing QFE does not affect QNH altitude.}
\ibi{Flight level}{Flight Level}{Pressure Altitude given as Flight Level. 
Only available if barometric altitude available and correct QNH set.}
\ibi{Barogram}{Barogram}{Trace of altitude during flight.}

\section{Aircraft state}

\ibi{Bearing}{Bearing}{True bearing of the next waypoint. For AAT tasks, this
is the true bearing to the target within the AAT sector.}
\ibi{Speed ground}{V GND}{Ground speed measured by the GPS. If this InfoBox is
active in simulation mode, pressing the up and down arrows adjusts the speed, 
left and right turns the glider.}
\ibi{Track}{Track}{Magnetic track reported by the GPS. (Touch-screen/PC only) If
this InfoBox is active in simulation mode, pressing the up and down arrows
adjusts the track.}
\ibi{Airspeed IAS}{V IAS}{Indicated Airspeed reported by a supported external
intelligent vario.}
\ibi{G load}{G}{Magnitude of G loading reported by a supported external
intelligent vario. This value is negative for pitch-down manoeuvres.}
\ibi{Bearing Difference}{Brng. D}{The difference between the glider's track
bearing, to the bearing of the next waypoint, or for AAT tasks, to the bearing
to the target within the AAT sector. GPS navigation is based on the track
bearing across the ground, and this track bearing may differ from the glider's
heading when there is wind present. Chevrons point to the direction the glider
needs to alter course to correct the bearing difference, that is, so that the
glider's course made good is pointing directly at the next waypoint.  This
bearing takes into account the curvature of the Earth.}
\ibi{Airspeed TAS}{V TAS}{True Airspeed reported by a supported external 
intelligent vario.}
\ibi{Attitude indicator}{Horizon}{Attitude indicator (artificial horizon) display 
calculated from flightpath, supplemented with acceleration and variometer data if 
available.}

\section{Glide ratio}

\ibi{GR instantaneous}{GR inst.}{Instantaneous glide ratio over ground, given 
by the ground
speed divided by the vertical speed (GPS speed) over the last 20 seconds. 
Negative values indicate climbing cruise. If the vertical speed is close to
zero, the displayed value is '---'.
If this InfoBox is active, pressing the enter cursor button brings up the
bugs and ballast dialogue.}
\ibi{GR cruise}{GR cru.}{The distance from the top of the last thermal,
divided by the altitude lost since the top of the last thermal. Negative values
indicate climbing cruise (height gain since leaving the last thermal). If the
vertical speed is close to zero, the displayed value is '---'.}
\ibi{Final GR (Total Energy compensated)}{Fin. GR-TE}{The required glide ratio 
over ground to finish the task, given by
the distance to go divided by the height required to arrive at the safety 
arrival height. Negative values indicate a climb is necessary to finish. If
the height required is close to zero, the displayed value is '---'.
Note that this calculation may be optimistic because it reduces the height required 
to finish by the excess energy height of the glider if its true airspeed is 
greater than the MacCready and best L/D speeds.}
\ibi{Final GR}{Fin. GR}{Geometric gradient to the arrival height above the final
waypoint. This is not adjusted for total energy.} 
\ibi{Next GR}{WP GR}{The required glide ratio over ground to reach the next waypoint,
given by the distance to next waypoint divided by the height required to arrive
at the safety arrival height.  Negative values indicate a climb is necessary
to reach the waypoint.  If the height required is close to zero, the displayed
value is '---'.
Note that this calculation may be optimistic because it reduces the height 
required to reach the waypoint by the excess energy height of the glider if 
its true airspeed is greater than the MacCready and best L/D speeds.}
\ibi{L/D vario}{L/D vario}{Instantaneous lift/drag ratio, given by the indicated
airspeed divided by the total energy vertical speed, when connected to an
intelligent variometer.  Negative values indicate climbing cruise. If the total
energy vario speed is close to zero, the displayed value is '---'.}
\ibi{GR average}{GR avg.}{The distance made in the configured period of time ,
divided by the altitude lost since then. Negative values are shown as 
\^{ }\^{ }\^{ } and indicate climbing cruise (height gain). Over 200 of GR the
value is shown as +++ . You can configure the period of averaging in the system setup.
Suggested values are 60, 90 or 120. Lower values will be closed to 
GR inst., and higher values will be closed to GR cruise. Notice that the distance 
is \textit{not} the straight line between your old and current position, it's exactly the 
distance you have made even in a zigzag glide. This value is not calculated while 
circling.}
