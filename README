Top Hat README
=============

Top Hat is a tactical glide computer for the Android and Linux operating
systems.  Although it runs on all the platforms supported by XCSoar such as 
Window PC (Top Hat is a GUI that runs on the XCSoar platform), we're focusing 
our time on a GUI that runs on Android and Linux.

This file is aimed at developers.  We don't have a developer manual yet.  If you 
would like to write one that would be appreciated.  Our general approach to development
is to design before we code.  Designing can mean many things including creation of
mockup screens, interactive prototypes, and testing concepts directly with pilots. 


Getting the source
------------------

The Top Hat source code is managed with git (http://git-scm.com/).  It
can be downloaded with the following command:

 git clone git://git.xcsoar.org/xcsoar/master/xcsoar.git

To update your repository, type:

 git pull

For more information, please refer to the git documentation.


Compiling from source
---------------------

To compile from source, you need:

- GNU make
- GNU compiler collection (gcc), version 4.6.2 or later
  or clang/LLVM 3.1 (with "make CLANG=y")
- rsvg (http://librsvg.sourceforge.net/)
- ImageMagick 6.4 (http://www.imagemagick.org/)
- xsltproc (http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html)
- Perl and XML::Parser

To cross-compile to (desktop) Windows, you need the mingw-w64 version of gcc:

 http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/

For Pocket PC / Windows CE / Windows Mobile, you need mingw32ce:

For Linux/Unix, you need:

- Boost (http://www.boost.org/)
- zlib (http://www.zlib.net/)
- CURL (http://curl.haxx.se/)
- SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/)
- SDL_ttf (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)
- SDL_image (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
- OpenGL
- to run XCSoar, you need one of the following fonts (Debian package):
  DejaVu (ttf-dejavu), Droid (ttf-droid), Freefont (ttf-freefont)

On Debian, you may install these using the following command:

 apt-get install make g++ \
   libboost-dev zlib1g-dev \
   libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev \
   libcurl4-openssl-dev \
   libxml-parser-perl \
   librsvg2-bin xsltproc \
   ttf-dejavu

For Android, you need:

- Android SDK (http://developer.android.com/sdk/)
- Android NDK r8b (http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/)
- Ogg Vorbis (http://www.vorbis.com/)

For Mac OS X, you need:
- GCC 4.6.2 or newer (http://hpc.sourceforge.net/, or homebrew, or Macports)
- Boost (http://www.boost.org/)
- zlib (http://www.zlib.net/)
- CURL (http://curl.haxx.se/)
- SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/)
- SDL_ttf (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)
- SDL_image (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
- libicns (http://icns.sourceforge.net/)

To compile, run:

 make TARGET=<target>

To compile on a Unix-like system (Linux, Mac), you may run the
configure script to detect the build toolchain (optional):

 ./configure
 make

Supported targets:

 PC: desktop Windows (32 bit)

 WIN64: desktop Windows (64 bit)

 PPC2000, PPC2003: Pocket PC (for PPC2002 devices, use PPC2000 target)

 WM5: Windows Mobile 5.0 and later

 WM5X, PPC2003X: same as above with code optimised for XScale CPUs

 ALTAIR: Triadis Altair

 UNIX: Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems, including Mac OS X

 UNIX32, UNIX64: like UNIX, but explicitly choose 32 or 64 bit build

 ANDROID: Android with ARMv6 CPU

 ANDROID7: Android with ARMv7 CPU

 ANDROID86: Android with x86 CPU

 ANDROIDMIPS: Android with MIPS CPU

 ANDROIDFAT: "fat" Android package for all supported CPUs

 CYGWIN: desktop Windows with Cygwin (experimental)

 WINE: WineLib (experimental)
