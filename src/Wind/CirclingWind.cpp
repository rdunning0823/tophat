About Windanalysation

Currently, the wind is being analyzed by finding the minimum and the maximum
groundspeeds measured while flying a circle. The direction of the wind is taken
to be the direction in wich the speed reaches it's maximum value, the speed
is half the difference between the maximum and the minimum speeds measured.
A quality parameter, based on the number of circles allready flown (the first
circles are taken to be less accurate) and the angle between the headings at
minimum and maximum speeds, is calculated in order to be able to weigh the
resulting measurement.

There are other options for determining the windspeed. You could for instance
add all the vectors in a circle, and take the resuling vector as the windspeed.
This is a more complex method, but because it is based on more heading/speed
measurements by the GPS, it is probably more accurate. If equiped with
instruments that pass along airspeed, the calculations can be compensated for
changes in airspeed, resulting in better measurements. We are now assuming
the pilot flies in perfect circles with constant airspeed, wich is of course
not a safe assumption.
The quality indication we are calculation can also be approched differently,
by calculating how constant the speed in the circle would be if corrected for
the windspeed we just derived. The more constant, the better. This is again
more CPU intensive, but may produce better results.

Some of the errors made here will be averaged-out by the WindStore, wich keeps
a number of windmeasurements and calculates a weighted average based on quality.
